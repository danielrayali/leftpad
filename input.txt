 Don't believe me? Well, that's good because you should always do your own
 independent research to develop your own opinons. Much like the intent of this article,
  I attempted to do some of my own into Bill Gates when I came
  across the allegation that he was trying to control the population  
  through vaccines. That's right, he's personally injecting deadly,
  poisonous cocktails directly into babies.

Bill and Melinda Gates, along with Warren Buffet started the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation to funnel money into areas it determines would
have the greatest impact in solving the worlds current problems.
One of these areas deals with climate change and CO2 emissions. Gates
did a TED talk in 2010 explaining the logic for how the
foundation invests its money. One of the things Gates mentioned is how controlling
 population growth plays an important role in not just reducing CO2 emissions but also helps 
 alleviate a number of problems. From a Forbes article from 2011,
  Gates claims that across the board
  problems with jobs, unrest, and education become harder when
  there is a high population density.
